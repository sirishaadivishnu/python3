# Programming Language: Python3

This repository contains the programs that I wrote during my traineeship as a full stack developer. These programs cover a wide range of topics, including Control Flow, Lists, Loops, Functions, Strings, Dictionaries, Files & Classes. There are hints of small bits and pieces of machine learning here and there as I gradually learn.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/sirishaadivishnu/python3.git
```

## Directory Structure

The repository doesn't contain any typical directory structure however, at the end of this Readme.md I have created a table to describe each program in the repository.

## Contributing

If you find any bugs or issues in the programs, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
